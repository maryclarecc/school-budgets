# school-budgets

There is a general trend that lower spending per student is associated with higher test scores for all subjects and overall. Students at charter schools perform better than students at district schools, as the top 5 school scores are charter and the bottom 5 school scores are district schools. Scorea are also better at smaller schools, which are more likely to be charter schools. In all, this means that spending more per student isn't necessarily the key to higher scores; rather, more attention per student is more likely tied to their success.
